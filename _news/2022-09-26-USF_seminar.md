I am giving a seminar at the University of San Francisco: "Breaking things to see how they work: predicting antibiotic resistance with massively parallel assays." Thanks to Professors [Janet Yang (USF)](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/janet-yang) and [Bassem Al-Sady (UCSF)](https://alsadylab.ucsf.edu/) for the opportunity!
