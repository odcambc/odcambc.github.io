Gabby's followup preprint performing inhibitor screens against MET kinase libraries is [now on biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.16.603579v1).

Priyanka and I also published a review of an interesting recent preprint by [Vincoff et al.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.03.597245v1) which fine-tuned ESM-2 on fusion oncoproteins. Read it on PREreview: https://prereview.org/reviews/12658078

Finally, I just joined the [organizing committee](https://www.varianteffect.org/vess-committee) of the [Atlas of Variant Effects](https://www.varianteffect.org/) seminar series.
