We had a few papers published recently: our paper on the drug transporter OCT1 was published in [Molecular Cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2024.04.008), and our [Rosace paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-024-03279-7) was just published in Genome Biology. Also, Matt's preprint on a proton-sensing GPCR is up on [bioRxiv](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.17.590000v1), as well as Gabby's preprint on [MET kinase](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.03.551866v3) fusions and activating mutations.
