abstract: 'This paper describes the total synthesis of dolastatin 16, a compound that had demonstrated extremely potent cytotoxicity when isolated from Dolabella auricularia, a sea slug. It was later found to likely be synthesized by Lyngbya majuscula, a cyanobacterial prolific producer of secondary metabolites.'
