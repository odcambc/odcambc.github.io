Our paper on OCT1 (SLC22A1) is out in Molecular Cell. It's been a lot of work and I'm glad it's out.

I wasted some time making a cover image. It didn't get used for some reason, but it makes me laugh.

<div class="container">
  <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
      {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/oct1_molecular-cell-cover.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>

Take a look at the nice [actual art](<https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/issue?pii=S1097-2765(23)X0011-2#>), too.
