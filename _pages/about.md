I graduated from Arizona State University with degrees in Mathematics and Biochemistry, where I conducted research in the total synthesis of marine natural products with Dr. George Pettit. Afterwards, I attended the University of Michigan for my Ph.D. in Biophysics. In the [Stockbridge](https://lsa.umich.edu/mcdb/people/faculty/stockbr.html) lab, I studied the evolution and function of bacterial membrane proteins involved in xenobiotic resistance, whether as fluoride channels or efflux transporters.

I am currently a member of the [Fraser](https://fraserlab.com/) and [Coyote-Maestas](https://www.wcoyotelab.com/) labs at UCSF, where I am using high-throughput functional genomics and structural approaches to understand the biophysics of protein evolution in contexts including antibiotic resistance, membrane protein folding and biogenesis, and kinase signalling. I love to tinker: with ideas as well as tools. I am currently spending some time in the [Raman lab](https://www.ramanlaboratory.org/) at UW-Madison as a visitor.

Outside of lab, I enjoy books, music, being outdoors and/or on a bike, and drinking normal amounts of coffee.

I am supported by a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NIGMS](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/).
