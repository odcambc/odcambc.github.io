  abstract = {The small multidrug resistance (SMR family) was named for its founding member, a promiscuous exporter of antibiotics and antiseptics, and has become an important model system in membrane protein mechanism and evolution. But most members of this family do not share drug export activity, and their function has been enigmatic. Here we show that the SMR family is mostly comprised of proteins that export guanidinium ion, a small, cationic metabolic byproduct. In addition to opening up an unusual bacterial physiology for further exploration, this work provides a comprehensive view of the SMR family and provides critical context to understand the evolution and mechanism of the multidrug transporters.           ,              The small multidrug resistance (SMR) family of membrane proteins is prominent because of its rare dual topology architecture, simplicity, and small size. Its best studied member, EmrE, is an important model system in several fields related to membrane protein biology, from evolution to mechanism. But despite decades of work on these multidrug transporters, the native function of the SMR family has remained a mystery, and many highly similar SMR homologs do not transport drugs at all. Here we establish that representative SMR proteins, selected from each of the major clades in the phylogeny, function as guanidinium ion exporters. Drug-exporting SMRs are all clustered in a single minority clade. Using membrane transport experiments, we show that these guanidinium exporters, which we term Gdx, are very selective for guanidinium and strictly and stoichiometrically couple its export with the import of two protons. These findings draw important mechanistic distinctions with the notably promiscuous and weakly coupled drug exporters like EmrE.},

  abstract = {By providing broad resistance to environmental biocides, transporters from the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family drive the spread of multidrug resistance cassettes among bacterial populations. A fundamental understanding of substrate selectivity by SMR transporters is needed to identify the types of selective pressures that contribute to this process. Using solid-supported membrane electrophysiology, we find that promiscuous transport of hydrophobic substituted cations is a general feature of SMR transporters. To understand the molecular basis for promiscuity, we solved X-ray crystal structures of a SMR transporter Gdx-Clo in complex with substrates to a maximum resolution of 2.3\,Å. These structures confirm the family’s extremely rare dual topology architecture and reveal a cleft between two helices that provides accommodation in the membrane for the hydrophobic substituents of transported drug-like cations.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Insertions and deletions (indels) are a major source of genetic variation in evolution and the cause of nearly 30\% of Mendelian disease. Despite their importance, indels are left out of nearly every systematic mutational scan to date due to technical challenges associated with making indel-containing libraries, limiting our understanding of indels in disease, biology, and evolution. Here we present a library generation method, DIMPLE, that generates deletions, insertions, and missense at similar frequencies within any gene. To benchmark DIMPLE, we generated libraries within four genes (Kir2.1, VatD, TRPV1, and OPRM1) of varying length and evolutionary origin. DIMPLE produces libraries that are near complete, low cost, and low bias. We measured how missense mutations and indels of varying length impact the potassium channel Kir2.1 surface expression. Across all Kir2.1’s secondary structure, deletions are more disruptive than insertions, beta sheets are extremely sensitive to large deletions, and flexible loops allow insertions far more frequently than deletions. DIMPLE’s low bias, ease of use, and low cost will enable high throughput probing of the importance of indels in disease and evolution.},
